          <li>
            Contrast: This site has good contract in relation to heading
            hierarchy, font, colors such as green used throughout the size, the
            use of shapes, and correct uses of bold words for emphasis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repitition: The green and orage bits of background color are used
            correctly throughout, making it look clean and organized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: The site is easy to understand, the bullet points are
            aligned, there are no random spaces/tabs/breaks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: the subjects, books, company info, and other information
            are grouped nicely

          <li>
            Repitition: The text shifts from upper/lowercase at odd intevals,
            there are mutiple styles that don't coincide cleanly
          </li>
          <li>
