        <p> Welcome to Alex Wyatt Inventions! I started this company with one main goal: to spread accesibility and
            creativity through Entrepreneurs websites.We started in 2025, and since then have increased businesses
            website-traffic by an average of 250%. In addition, the businesses have moved up an average of 10 spots
            on Search Engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Take a look around, and see if your business could
            use some extra "inventing".
